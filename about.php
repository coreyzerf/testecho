		<h2>About Echo Lake Camp
			<small class="text-muted">Fifty-Plus Years of History</small>

			Echo Lake Camp was founded in 1956 as a youth-oriented facility. For over 50 years, Echo has been continuing to follow its mission statement of "Winning youth to Christ and equipping them to glorify God."

			Echo Lake Camp is affiliated with the Free Methodist Church of Canada, and is a charitable organization that is maintained solely through the work of its many unpaid volunteer staff members.
